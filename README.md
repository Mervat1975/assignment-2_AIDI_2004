Breast cancer data includes 569 observations of cancer biopsies, each with 32 characteristics (variables).
One feature is an identification number (ID), another is a cancer diagnosis, and 30 are numerical
laboratory measurements. The diagnosis is coded as "M" to indicate malignant or "B" for indicate benign.
 
 
 Progrm is a classification algorithm to predict the diagnostic. 
 the goal is to apply cross- validation first to identify the better algorithm
(accuracy) to be used (at least consider Decision Trees,Random Forest and KNN). 
After the identification a strategy  is applied to improve the accuracy
based on hypermeters to achieve the best % of accuracy.
